#  a simple way to provide informations for contributors 

## Abstract

   Open source projects rely on the cooperation of third parties.  Other
   websites also rely on user feedback, for example, when bugs occur.
   There are various platforms that enable effective collaboration.
   However, this diversity also presents a challenge.  Where should
   users who have discovered an error report it?  Or how can third
   parties participate in a project?  This document presents one way to
   communicate such information in a consistent manner.
